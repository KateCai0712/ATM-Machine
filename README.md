# ATM-Machine
Design a simple ATM service kiosk. This kiosk supports the following options for its menu:
1. View your account balance
2. Deposit Cash
3. Withdraw cash
4. Exit

Initially, the account balance is $0.00. When you deposit cash, this account balance is increased by your deposit amount. Similarly, when you withdraw cash, this account balance is decreased by your withdrawal amount. You cannot withdraw more than what exists in the account. Similarly, you cannot deposit a negative cash amount. Use if-else statements or switch statement to perform the respective operation in the menu. The ATM kiosk provides these three options until the user selects the option to leave the kiosk. At the end of every transaction, the user is being asked if they need to perform another transaction. You may want to use a do-while statement to satisfy this last requirement.
